# TextAdventure
A single player text adventure similar to MUDs of the 90s.

This is a generic text adventure game that I started writing in my high school computer science class. It's loosely modeled after MUDs like Aardwolf.
It is strictly single player, and I do not plan to add multiplayer functionality any time soon. 

#Installation

This is another cross-platform project that will run on any operating system. It was initially built in Eclipse under Windows 7, and all future development
was done on Ubuntu 14.04. To compile in Windows, simply add the folders to a new project in an IDE of your choice and compile. On any platform,
you may run the `compile` script in the command line to generate an executable jar file.
